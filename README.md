Jujube-YOLO is a deep learning model based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, specifically designed for the detection of jujube fruits in agricultural settings. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to efficiently detect and classify jujube fruits on trees. The goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated jujube fruit detection, reducing the need for manual labor.
